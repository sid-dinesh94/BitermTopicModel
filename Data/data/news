11343	Fri, 25 Jan 2013 00:42:00 GMT	Yes, Madam Secretary, At This Point It Does Matter	http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-915422	 "What difference, at this point, does it make?" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Senate Foreign Relations Committee January 23, 2013 Outgoing? Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressed two committees of Congress? on Wednesday about the terrorist attack on the US diplomatic mission in? Benghazi, Libya. It was during the first hearing before the Senate? Foreign Relations Committee that has sparked a certain amount of? controversy in her response to Republican Senator Ron Johnson of? Wisconsin. I? understand the Secretary's frustration. I understood what she meant? that "at this point" what is important is too learn from the mistakes? and move forward. We cannot bring back the dead nor undo the wrong, but? hopefully we can lessen a similar incident and similar mistakes in the? future. That I get. However,? I think Clinton did not quite grasp the issue being asked since Clinton? from day one and her department have rightfully characterized the? attack as being perpetrated by terrorists with connection to Al Qaeda.? Clinton has accepted her responsibility for the short comings and? failings that led up to the tragedy. But that is not the issue. Perhaps? the Secretary was the wrong person to be hammering on this issue.? President Barack Obama already came to the defence of United Nations? Ambassador Susan Rice for her appearance on five Sunday talk news shows.? The President said to ask him, to put the onus on him. He is right. While? State and Clinton have acknowledged from the beginning that Benghazi? was a planned terrorist attack on our mission, it is not really Clinton? who should explain why the President, the White House and Rice seemed to? try and divert attention away from what the whole world knew? immediately was a terrorist attack and blame it on an obscure, poorly? crafted video by a shady producer with an anti-Islam agenda. To me it is more a question the President should come before the committees and answer. Clinton? even noted that when you don't know the cause for sure, you should just? say that, rather than pull a response out of the air. The? question deals with being truthful and upfront with the American? people. The question deals with not making a storyline fit a political? agenda. A? terrorist attack on the Benghazi mission on September 11, 2012 did not? coincide with the Administration and the re-election storyline that Al? Qaeda was on the run, that Al Qaeda has been decimated. That storyline? still continues even today in spite of evidence to the contrary:? Benghazi, the Algerian hostage standoff with the deaths of another four? Americans, the ongoing conflict in northern Mali. While? the mother group of Al Qaeda may have been dealt a fatal blow, closely? aligned or new incarnations of the fanatical ideology of extreme? jihadism is alive and well and thriving. The war on terror, contrary to? some in the Administration, is far from over. We are losing and still? not wining the hearts and minds of those who would see our destruction. It? was a political calculation to deflect what happened at Benghazi and to? refrain from use of the terms "terrorism" and "Al Qaeda". But it was a? flawed calculation that just keeps giving fodder to those who buy into? cover-ups and conspiracies. Where? I disagree with Clinton is her reference in the hearings to allowing? the FBI to continue its investigation and not get in the way of that? investigation. The same occurred during her husband's administration? following the attack on one of our naval vessels docked in the Middle? East. This? is not a criminal case, where gathering evidence to prosecute in a? court must be done. Remember the same occurred after the USS Cole? incident. We had to gather evidence to prosecute those responsible? rather than call the bombing what we know now it was...a terrorist? attack by Al Qaeda. The US did not act to extract vengeance and justice.? The terrorists saw this as a sign of weakness. A year or so later, the Twin Towers tumbled in shambles and mayhem killing over 3,000 on American soil. Failure to admit that Al Qaeda, even in its offshoots, is not decimated? and is still a real threat is the problem and the issue. Had we? responded immediately and with force to Benghazi, perhaps the Al Qaeda? leaning terrorists would not have been emboldened to attack and kill? four more Americans and others in Algeria. The hesitancy shown? in dealing with Benghazi as a terrorist attack, as well as an act of? terror by Nidal Hasan in the Fort Hood mass shooting and not a "work? place act of violence",? only tells these fanatics and extremists bent? on destroying our nation that we don't have the balls to hit back and? hit back hard in spite of pronouncements to "bring the perpetrators to? justice". We have to stop thinking in terms of criminal cases? and realize and accept this is war, not a courtroom with adversarial? roles of prosecutor and defense attorney. It? matters, Madam Secretary, because over four months have passed. It? matters, Madam Secretary, because another four Americans have died? because of Al Qaeda related terrorists, this time in Algeria. It? matters, Madam Secretary, because Al Qaeda in yet another inception has a? foothold in northern Mali. It matters, Madam Secretary, because the? dialogue out of the Administration does not match the reality on the? ground. The? zealots of jihadist extremism, inspired by Osama Bin Laden, are growing? and becoming more daring and brazen. These fanatics see the United? States as weak and not having the wherewithal to follow through on? threats of swift justice and vengeance. No, Madam Secretary, the onus does not lie with you. The onus lies with the occupant of the Oval Office. From? the Cornfield, it matters that the President clearly tells the American? people that terrorism is still very real and a threat to our American? way of life. It matters that Congress addresses the questions to the? right people. As? Clinton noted herself, just because the mainland US has not been hit? since that awful day of 9/11/2001, it does not mean that these? terrorists are not still plotting, planning and waiting for another try? to inflict the most harm and do the most destruction. 	1359074520

11345	Thu, 24 Jan 2013 23:07:05 GMT	Ice Cross Returns to St. Paul	http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-915297	 Red Bull is at it again. &nbsp; The energy drink company, fast becoming known for its sponsorship of extreme sports, and most recently as the main sponsor of Felix Baumgartner's record setting jump from the edge of space, is back in St. Paul for the Red Bull Crashed Ice World Championship, 2013. &nbsp; This year's run is slightly longer than last year, coming in at about 400 meters of man made ice atop a scaffolding that begins with a near vertical drop 48 feet above the frozen ground. After that, things get interesting; jumps, sudden rises, even more sudden drop offs, a hairpin turn, and a rather abrupt end. The competitors, wearing hockey skates and pads, will reach speeds approaching, even exceeding 40mph. And while training and practice runs are made one person at a time, the finals are done four abreast. &nbsp; Known more formally as Ice Cross, the sport began some ten years ago when an intrepid adrenaline junkie decided it was a good idea to skate down a bobsled run. The idea caught on and competitive ice cross was born. &nbsp; Now, instead of a bobsled run, the course is made over the course of nearly three weeks with an elaborate scaffolding and thousands of gallons of frozen water. &nbsp; The sites for this year's series include not only St. Paul, Minnesota, but Quebec City and Niagara Falls in Canada, Landgraaf in the Netherlands, and Lausanne in Switzerland. &nbsp; Today in St. Paul the training runs began with an inaugural run by the city's Mayor, Chris Coleman and Father Nels Gjengdahl of the Arch Diocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis. &nbsp; What followed was a lot of slipping, crashing and learning about the track, its speed, and how unforgiving its going to be in the arctic cold that has gripped the region in the past weeks. &nbsp; Semi Finals are Friday, January 25th, and Finals are Saturday the 26th at 7pm CST. Some 80,000 people are expected to be on site for the event, braving the chill of zero degrees. 	1359068825

The race starts from the top of an ice coated ramp four stories high, with a vertical drop of 40 meters, and progresses steeply downhill for a total length of 400 meters through a series of switchback turns and high jumps with names like "the Downtown Drop" and "Hangman Hill". The track itself takes 20 days to build, and uses 25,000 gallons (100,000 liters) of water for the heavy coating of ice that covers the track from top to bottom. Weather during construction has ranged from -4C to -26 C. Today, the Honorable Chris Coleman, Mayor of the Capital City of St. Paul inaugurated the track with a successful run down the track (2484A). The remainder of the day was to allow new race participants to try out the track and find out what horrors awaited them along the way; some more successfully than others. As one participant told me, "It look a lot easier from the outside than actually skating down it!". The elimination race begins tomorrow at 10.00 am CST. 	1359059562

She and her parents, Irma and Miguel are originally from Mexico. Carolina?s younger siblings, Danny, 15, Keren, 12, and Josue, 11, were born and raised in the United States. In 2011, Mr. Parra got into a car accident, revealing his undocumented status. During the deportation hearing that followed, Danny testified on behalf of his father. After Danny told the judge that he and his siblings needed their father around, the judge tossed out his father?s deportation order. Carolina and her siblings are focused on school now. Danny, a straight-A student, hopes to participate this summer in an engineering program at Johns Hopkins or Stanford University. Josue is still figuring school out, as he attracts the eyes of his female classmates. Despite all the distractions, he is still managing to meet the academic expectations of his family. As a mixed-status family, about the only vacation they?ve tried was to the Wisconsin Dells. But according to Carolina, the future is looking bright. 	1358991572
11351	Thu, 24 Jan 2013 01:09:19 GMT	Women in the military: My take	http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-914501	 I am a woman who served 28 years in the U.S. Air Force. I retired 4 years ago from being a first sergeant in the AFSOC command at Hurlburt Field Florida. &nbsp; I am extremely pleased to see this long over due decision by the U.S. military. While I have seen some wimpy women -- whom I would never recommend to any special combat duty jobs -- I have seen many well qualified women who would be a true asset for combat duty, but have been denied those positions simply because of their gender. &nbsp; Many of these women could whip anyone's ass, mentally as well as physically! The same holds true for men. Now, finally, men or women can apply for these positions and they can be judged on an individual basis and not just on what they have between their legs. &nbsp; As long as women can do the same as their male counterparts (and many can), then there is no reason why they could not go directly into combat. If some men have a problem with that, then they need to work it out amongst themselves and stop penalizing women. &nbsp; This is a very proud moment for me. If you would like me to comment more, please let me know. Thank you for the opportunity. 	1358989759
11352	Thu, 24 Jan 2013 00:02:51 GMT	Supportive Combat Role vs Combat Role: We Females Are Already on the Front Line	http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-914863	 I just completed my first deployment to Afghanistan this past year. I worked as the Public Affairs non-commissioned officer in charge for an infantry brigade combat team as well as an ad hoc advisor for a security force assistance team that worked with the Afghan Border Police. I completed over 70 missions in 6 months and, on a few of those missions, I was the only female. Technically, I had a supportive combat role and the infantryman walking next to me had a combat role but I don't think the enemy would really know the difference if he decided to shoot. &nbsp; Do I feel that women should be allowed to be in combat roles? There is a complicated answer to that. I believe in gender-equality in the workplace but I also understand that there are physical and mental differences between men and women. &nbsp; As for equality, I think there will be a small group of military females who will look at Mr. Panetta's decision as an opportunity to prove themselves in some feminist-based retort to the past 19 years of being told to stay out of combat roles. I have worked with some female service members that do possess the mental attitude and the physical strength and endurance to do exactly what their male counterparts are capable of and I believe these women will thrive in the newly-opened combat roles. &nbsp; The concept of letting females in combat roles is more than an equaility issue though. Most of us are not phyically built to carry heavy weapons. Where men lack in abdominal muscles, women lack in upper body strength. This is reflected in our physical fitness test requirements. For example, men are required to do more push-ups and women are expected do more sit-ups. Very few women I know can do pull-ups. We just aren't built for it. That doesn't mean that every woman can't do them... just the odds are against us. Our military scoring systems for fitness fitness are two different scales - one set for men and one set for women - because we are built differently. &nbsp; Women are already is support roles in combat and we are already on the front lines. We just haven't trained in some of the specific Military Occupational Specialities (MOS) that allow us to say we are in a combat role. We are already in a danger area whether we are in a combat role or a supportive combat role. &nbsp; The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the Army, DOD, or the U.S. Government. 	1358985771
11353	Wed, 23 Jan 2013 23:59:43 GMT	Women In Combat	http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-914500	 I trained in an infantry combat unit and females trained right along beside us; they did everything we did: crawl under low-strung razorwire under live-fire conditions, threw handgrenades, hand-to-hand combat, fired missiles, drove jeeps on the obstacle course and even finished some training events before, better and faster than some men. Also, women were leaders and fightersin in the Bible: Deborah led the Israelites in peace and in war. She was a prophetess, but when war came she devised a battle strategy that gave the out-numbered and badly-equipped Israelite troops victory over their Canaanite enemy. Another woman, Jael, used a tent peg and a mallet to finish off the unfortunate enemy general, Sisera. So I don't see any problem with it.

She is from Timbuktu but lives in Guinea-Bissau where she is Country Director for Plan International. &nbsp; Home has changed; before it was peace, joy and love, now it is shame, terror and abuse. &nbsp; When entering the city the signboard which was: ?Welcome to Timbuktu the city of 333 saints? is now ?Welcome to Timbuktu the gate to the application of the Shariya?. &nbsp; When reading this, it gives me a sense of what I should expect. The women are obliged to hide themselves inside their houses or cover their body while out if not they are taken to the prisons where they can be raped with no consequence. Our men are traumatized, no one wants shame within his family, so they decided to admit the unacceptable and avoid confrontation that may lead to amputation or even death. &nbsp; Everyday there are gunshots; if not to disperse women marching, it is to kill dogs that are barking which are preventing the insurgents from sleeping. &nbsp; While I was there they called a meeting with the city crisis group to discuss: education, power and implementation of the Shariya. &nbsp; One condition to reopen the school was to have separate classes for boys and girls. Girls will be taught by female teachers - being from Timbuktu, I know that this is a pure utopia because we don?t have enough teachers, especially female teachers to do so. &nbsp; The right to education is therefore automatically denied to those children whose parents cannot afford to send them to the south. &nbsp; To secure running water and four hours electricity per day, they ask a contribution per family on electricity consumption but they could not reach an agreement on the amount of money. &nbsp; The insurgents say they understand the stress people are under as a result of the implementation of Shariya law but insist there is no other way because Shariya is cornerstone of their fight. &nbsp; They have proposed training young people in Shariya law and have them go from family to family teaching them however the population did not agree. They feared that after the insurgents left the city the youth might continue to enforce Shariya. &nbsp; The Islamists I saw were very young boys, all speaking Bambara, Soninke, Fullah Tamasheq, Arabic or French. I presume they are Malians like us and many are from Timbuktu previously working for the MNLA. &nbsp; The question to which I could not find a clear answer remains why as Malians are we putting shame on our women, raping our girls, traumatizing our brothers in one of the oldest Islamic city in the country on the name of GOD? Why? &nbsp; As usual people continue to stay optimistic and think GOD is watching them, that He has the solution and He will end this one day. &nbsp; For me the fundamental question is: When is this going to end? So skeptical but so true to say maybe ?NEVER?. 	1358947602
11359	Wed, 23 Jan 2013 07:54:45 GMT	Skill	http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-914468	 In the Philippines, where the number of poverty stricken citizenry is estimated at 23 million (Philippine National Statistical Coordination Board, 2009), a considerable number of youths drop out from school due to financial restrictive conditions and choose employment to improve family means and help put food on the table. Frequently, in poor rural areas surrounded with low work rate, low production, ineffective technology and insufficient support system, many youths search for work outside of their communities. Work migration increases with numerous young people taking jobs as plantation or factory workers or domestic helpers in other cities. Several girls who are not able to complete their education get married and become mothers at a tender age and in consequence of that, face more challenges. On November 23, 2012, I met Nory Anne Sedano, 17. Sedano comes from a large family that earns a scanty income. Just like most parents, Sedano's father and mother believe that sending their children to school is advantageous - only, it will yield results in the future. For the time being, it involves expenditure of money, time and labor. With 6 siblings and the struggle of Sedano's parents, she almost dropped out from school. But because of Sedano's strong will and ambition, she took advantage of a training opportunity that was given to her in school - dressmaking. With hardwork, and the help of her school and a local program, she was able to put up a small dress shop. And because of a number of loyal customers who helped her earn income, she was able to support and send herself to school. Nory Anne Sedano is from Tobias Fornier, Antique, Philippines. Sedano is single and a dressmaker. Her dressmaking skills helped her graduate at the General Leonardo Fullon National School - with honors. When I met Sedano last year, it was during a conference in Makati City, Philippines. She was a guest speaker. Sedano shared her life story and has become an inspiration to many of the youths in the convention. &nbsp; When asked what her next plan is, she held the microphone and shyly said "Gusto ko po makapag tapos ng kolehiyo. Gusto ko po talaga... (I would like to finish college. I really want to.)" and after a brief pause, with great dignity, she added. "At talagang hindi po muna ako mag aasawa. (And I really don't want to get married yet.)" &nbsp; Photo 1 - Sedano, donning a blouse she designed and created, speaks before an audience.

11365	Tue, 22 Jan 2013 22:17:03 GMT	Fight, Bleed, Die - Equality? No	http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-914358	 We? are in a new era or so we are told. It was evident during Monday's? inaugural speech by President Barack Obama accepting the trust of the US? of A for a second term. The President made history by use of the term? "gay" twice during his address to the nation. He also placed the? Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City, reputed to be the start of the? gay rights movement, on the same footing with the civil rights? milestones of Seneca Falls for women's rights and the Selma March for? African-American rights. Yet,? as historic and how flourishing the rhetoric, which placed the fight by? the GLBT for equality in America by the President on the front page, it? does not match up to the reality on the ground. Out? military service members may now openly fight in wars and battles? deemed in the national interest. Out members may now bleed to uphold and? protect the Constitution of the United States. Out gay and lesbian? military personel may die to ensure our freedoms guaranteed under the? Bill of Rights. But when it comes to legal same-gender spouses having? the same rights, benefits and privileges as those of opposite-gender? spouses, the military and Department of Defense says, "No." Yes,? thanks to President Obama, unlike when I was in the Air Force, men and? women no longer have to keep their sexuality in the "closet".? Being out? and proud is no longer an impediment to service to the nation. But, as? many news reports attest in the last week and lawsuits filed in federal? court over the last year, equality is still not a reality for out? service members and their legal same-gender spouses. Unlike? opposite-gender spouses, same-gender spouses cannot recieve a military? identification card. Same-gender spouses are denied medical benefits and? cannot seek treatment at military hospitals. Same-gender couples cannot? receive housing allowances offered to opposite-gender couples. From? medical benefits, access to clubs and associations, base commissary? privileges and so much more, these are denied to the loved ones who are? legally wed same-gender spouses. The? Army cites that the Uniform Code of Military Justice does not provide? for an exception for sexual orientation in the anti-discrimination? statute. The Marine Corps by contrast, when it comes to clubs and? associations, is pressing those civilian, but military support? organizations, to open the doors to same-gender spouses if those? associations want to continue to meet and operate on base. The Department of Defense has come out in defense of the Army's stand. While? the President talks about acceptance and furtherance of equality for? same-gender couples, he has not proposed legislation to change the UCMJ.? The President has not sent any guidance to the DOD to allow or provide? for equality of same-gender spouses. Talk is fine, but it is action that matters. The? President's Administration has dropped defending the 1996 Defense of? Marriage Act (DOMA) in court. But at the same time, the President has? not sent legislation to Congress to repeal DOMA. The President continues? to allow his departments to discriminate against same-gender couples? across the nation even in states where same-gender couples enjoy legal? status. The? Supreme Court in March will take on DOMA. How the Court rules may? either advance equality or will push the fight for equality back for a? decade or more. It? is time for more than just lofty speeches. It is time for action to? ensure that all Americans are treated equally and fairly under the law. From? the Cornfield, while I still believe whether to grant legal status to? same-gender and opposite-gender couples falls under states rights and? authority, the federal government has no business denying equality? especially after a state has granted that equality. It is time for a lot? less talk and a lot more action from President Obama on the federal? level and especially with same-gender military spouses. If? our out military members can fight, bleed and die for our country,? their loved ones, those spouses keeping the home fires burning deserve? to be treated equally under the law. http://nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/gay-spouses-face-a-fight-for-acceptance-in-the-military.html http://washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-invokes-gay-rights-in-inaugural-address/2013/01/21/78bbc410-6409-11e2-b84d-21c7b65985ee_story.html 	1358893023

However, maybe that was not the path he so chose and he knew long ago where his feet were to be best planted. He had played college football...did well in college..........and could really do anything he wanted, however he enlisted in an officers training program in the marines. None of the younger Weisman men or women have ever evaluated military options, however Matt is different. He is focused......severely athletic........hard nosed and kind..........and truly does the right thing just about all the time. In fact, I am proud to be a cousin of Matt and have a good friendship with him. Matt is quiet......but even when he is not talking you can tell he is looking ahead. He is very confident with a strong self awareness that is one to only respect. Matt is one of the few people I know who could be a "great" anything and I am certain will be a leader in due time. &nbsp; I have watched many friends and family go to law school....become doctors.......however, I have watched few of these people truly go after their true passion. Matt is true to serving the US and is passionate about learning his craft. It is more than impressive.....he is doing what he is meant to do as we all should. Time is limited and the largest income earner is not the winner....it is getting what you want out of time that makes the most sense. I learned that long ago.....and I am glad Matt knows that as much as anyone. We can all create a path and own it. Matt has done just that! The age gap that is between Matt and I is meaningless as we both share two things.....we have the same last name and have chosen a different path.? Today he has rank......but the highest rank I admire is being related to Matt....and having a relationship despite the years that could easily seperate us. &nbsp; By Bradley D.

Just like they protested on January 25, 2011 against Mubarak and against SCAF rule on January 25, 2012, today they protested against the Muslim Brotherhood rule. Marches flooded the streets condemning the MB-sponsored constitution, the increasing prices of life essentials and the "Ikhwanization" of the Egyptian institutions. As clashes continued in Qasr El Einy and Sheikh Rihan streets, they erupted in other cities all over the country between protesters and Central Security Forces. By late afternoon the Shubra march was met by civilians in Tawfeekeya throwing glass bottles and rocks and shooting bird shot at them from above the Ikhwan Online office building. Clashes continued for a few minutes until protesters were able to stop them and the march continued to Tahrir. By the evening clashes increased fiercely all over the country between protesters and the CSF. Endless number of tear gas canisters, Molotov cocktails, rocks and birdshot were seen everywhere. Martyrs fell in Suez killed by live ammunition. And what was supposed to be the Tahrir sit-in got dispersed, but after a few minutes protesters got back to the square. 	1359150001

12526	Fri, 25 Jan 2013 23:47:26 GMT	The Second Anniversary of Egypt's 25 January Revolution	http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-915924	 In Egypt now, it takes a revolution to start a family, to seek truths, to request justice, and more to grow up. Although Egypt?s revolution was heavily catalyzed by youth, little has changed for them. Today marked the second anniversary of Egypt's 25 January Revolution amid an unprecedentedly charged and polarized political atmosphere. Today also marked a real challenge of Egypt?s future, injustice and the untapped potentials of its young generation or their anger. Several marches were set out for Tahrir Square from different areas of Cairo or to the Presidential Palace. Additional rallies marched in several governorates in Alexandria, Ismalia, Suez, the Red Sea, Kafr Al-Sheikh, Assuit, Port Said, and Sharqiya. There were thousands of protesters in the square today, but the violence was restricted to small corners of it, where young people, teenagers, and children were throwing stones at the police forces standing behind the walls. Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters who had tried to cross the streets leading to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, a life long symbol of oppression and current suspect of many crimes happened during and after the revolution. Torn by last year?s tragedy, Egypt?s Ahly Football Club hardcore fans ? Ultras Ahlawy held several marches throughout the week reminding people of the Port Said massacre victims. More than 70 young fans were killed last February following a match and the Ultras belames the police forces and the military council. Last Wednesday, Ultras Ahlawy- blocked the Cairo metro, stopped the traffic on 6th of October Bridge, and sieged the stock exchange building to demand a swift verdict in the Port Said trial. The incident shocked Cairo and announced a stronger player in Egypt?s politics. Meanwhile, adolescents and youth in Egypt remain in the dark. School curricula lack basic information and civil society efforts are restricted by the government and don?t reach the necessary numbers of youth. Young people obtain their education in an inefficient system based on rote learning in overcrowded classrooms with little space for expression, creativity, and self-fulfillment. So it was not surprising to see them today easily crash into a nearby-unattended school in Shikh Rihan Street to get some of its furniture to set it on fire. Actually, the fire was set because of the believe that fire calms down the effects of the continuous tear gas fired by the police forces. I met Aly in Tahrir Square, a 14th years old who were celebrating his birthday today by coming to Tahrir Square to participate. Aly told me that it is not allowed to talk about politics in school and teachers avoid any reference to what is happening in that sphere. 	1359157646

12557	Sat, 26 Jan 2013 21:41:20 GMT	WINTER WEATHER in SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TOO!	http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-915770	 While the rest of the country is suffering from some terrible Arctic chill, we here in California have not been left out of the weather calamity. &nbsp; I know it's hard to believe, but the about an inch of rainfall we have received this past weekend has cause the San Diego River to overflow it's boundaries in Mission Valley and blocked one of the main roads into the best shopping center in town. &nbsp; This might not compare to the freezing t-shirts and water that turns into ice in midair back east, but it is a big deal to those of us who watch how one little road is always closed off at the slightest bit of local precipitation. &nbsp; Since Mission and Fashion Valley malls were built on a flood plain, this is par for the course in the winter. But this is minor flooding, compared to previous years when the water comes roaring down the San Diego River over the street and San Diego Lifeguards have to stand by, in case any one needs rescuing. &nbsp; Heavy rains have always caused the San Diego River to rise to the point that it floods and city crews make haste to close off Avenida del Rio at Camino de la Reina. This blocks a heavily-used road in-and-out of the Fashion Valley Mall in Mission Valley. &nbsp; The flooding is inconvenient for shoppers and those of us who like to see movies at the AMC Fashion Valley on rainy days. But this minor flooding is nothing compared to the heavy runoff back in December 2010, when a series of severe storms "damaged a service road at the mall, swamped a nearby golf course and flooded the field at Qualcomm Stadium," according to a story in the San Diego Union / Tribune. &nbsp; Still, the roiling water headed towards the sea does make for some dramatic photos and give us quiche-eaters here in California the sensation that we, too, also experience extreme weather conditions, just like the rest of the country. 	1359236480
