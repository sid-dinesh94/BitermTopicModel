code
-------------------------

We also include the code of algorithm WTMF-G used in the paper.

The package uses IT++ (http://itpp.sourceforge.net/current), a C++ library for matrix operations.
Make sure IT++ 4.2 (http://itpp.sourceforge.net/current) is correctly installed.
After installing IT++ on your machine, set the environment variables (assume itpp is installed in /home/user2/ss/tools/itpp):
      PATH=$PATH:/home/user2/ss/tools/itpp/bin
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/user2/ss/tools/itpp/lib  
Also, change the first two lines in Makefile (FLAGS_OPT and LIBS_OPT) to point to the right location of itpp config file.

To train a model:
./wtmf  1  data_file  weight_file  graph_file  model_file_prefix  100  20  0.01  3  20
An example is: ./wtmf  1  ../data/model/train.ind  ../data/model/train.weight.ind  ../data/model/nb.ind  ../data/model/model  100  20  0.01  3  20

It takes 10 parameters:
    (1) The value of first parameter is either 1 (train) or 0 (test)
    (2) The second parameter specifies the data file, which contains the values in data matrix X.  An example of the format of the file is data/model/train.ind. It is also the corpus we used in the experiments. 
    (3) The weight file, which contains the values in the weight matrix W.  An example is data/model/train.weight.ind .
    (4) The file that defines the similar word pairs.  An example is data/model/nb.ind (the 4 subgraphs)
    (5) the output of the model file prefixed by "model_file_prefix".
    (6) number of dimensions.
    (7) lambda: regularization weight.
    (8) the weight of missing words.
    (9) the weight of links (delta in our paper).
    (10) the iteration of alternating least square.

The latent vectors of short text is stored at model_file_prefix.q
